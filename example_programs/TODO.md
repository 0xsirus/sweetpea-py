# To-dos for Example Programs

Some of the example programs appear to be broken:

  * [ ] `Gratton1992.py` does not run.
  * [ ] `Multiple_crossings.py` takes a long time. Maybe we need to indicate
        progress?
      * Takes 5 minutes to complete
      * Finds 0 trial sequences.
  * [ ] `PadmalaPessoa2011.py` finds 0 trial sequences.
  * [ ] `Paper.py` finds 0 trial sequences.
  * [x] `Shenhav_et_al_2017.py` appears to work.
  * [ ] `Stroop_congruency_balanced.py` finds 0 trial sequences.
  * [ ] `Stroop_simple.py` finds 0 trial sequences.
  * [ ] `TaskSwitching_simple.py` finds 0 trial sequences.

I don't *think* they're all supposed to find 0 trial sequences, so I'm assuming
this is an indication that something is wrong. This will require more debugging.
